**Stonington Financial Group - Who We Are And What We Do**

Stonington Financial Group, LLC ("Stonington") is a boutique investment firm specializing in identifying, developing, and man-aging niche investment opportunities in real estate and real es-tate finance and derivatives through a variety of platforms.

Our investment platforms have several common objectives: first-ly, acquiring assets at a discount to current market value, with attractive profit spreads achieved through a significant value-added component; and, secondly, a clearly defined short-term exit strategy to capture the profit spread.

Our investment programs are geared towards delivering high returns from positions with excess asset coverage in a relatively short duration, by employing a wide variety of property manage-ment and oversight techniques to enhance asset values and overall returns on investment.

We have direct relationships with various REO and loan portfolio disposition platforms that afford us an edge when it comes to evaluating and pricing portfolios during the auction process. With our in-house and partner expertise in underwriting, portfolio strategy, management, property renovation, repositioning, and disposition, Stonington provides turnkey management services to achieve each program's stated investment objectives.
